**Hotel Management System**

**Introduction**

The Hotel Management System automates hotel operations, including reservations, check-ins/outs, room management, and billing. It enhances efficiency by allowing real-time access to room availability and guest information, reducing manual effort for hotel staff.

**OOP Concepts**
1. Classes & Objects: Classes like Sign-In, Manage Room, and Payment handle operations with instantiated objects.
2. Encapsulation: Methods and data are hidden within classes using access modifiers.
3. Inheritance & Polymorphism: Reuse common properties with inheritance, and method overriding allows flexibility in different classes.
4. Abstraction & Association: Simplify complex entities into classes with relationships between them (e.g., Main class and CustomerCheckin).
   
**Features**
1. Room Management: Manage room types, rates, and availability.
2. Reservations: Handle bookings and pricing.
3. Check-In/Check-Out: Assign rooms and update availability.
4. Billing: Generate guest bills and process payments.
5. Security: User authentication and access control for data protection.
   
**Technologies Used**

Java: Core language used for implementing logic and OOP concepts.
SQL: Database for storing hotel data, including reservations, guest information, and billing records.

**Interfaces**
